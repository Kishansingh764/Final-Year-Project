Built using Next.js with TypeScript for a scalable frontend, styled with Tailwind CSS for clean UI/UX, and integrated with Firebase as Backend-as-a-Service, this system also utilizes Firestore (Firebase Database) for real-time data storage and retrieval. The Vapi Voice AI model powers interactive voice-based communication, making the interview experience highly immersive and personalized.

# 🧠 Problem Statement
Preparing for interviews—especially in the fields of IoT, technology, and software development—can be challenging due to limited access to realistic, real-time practice environments. Traditional methods like written Q&A, peer interviews, or mock sessions often lack consistency, real-time feedback, and adaptability to individual learning needs.

There is a growing need for a smart, accessible, and interactive solution that can simulate real interview experiences, especially for students and working professionals aiming to enhance their communication, technical knowledge, and confidence. Additionally, incorporating voice interaction is crucial to mirror actual interview dynamics.
This project addresses these challenges by creating an AI-based Mock Interview System Agent that uses voice-enabled AI and modern web technologies to deliver a scalable, personalized, and immersive mock interview experience
