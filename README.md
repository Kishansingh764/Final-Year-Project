# üß† Problem Statement
Preparing for interviews‚Äîespecially in the fields of IoT, technology, and software development‚Äîcan be challenging due to limited access to realistic, real-time practice environments. Traditional methods like written Q&A, peer interviews, or mock sessions often lack consistency, real-time feedback, and adaptability to individual learning needs.

There is a growing need for a smart, accessible, and interactive solution that can simulate real interview experiences, especially for students and working professionals aiming to enhance their communication, technical knowledge, and confidence. Additionally, incorporating voice interaction is crucial to mirror actual interview dynamics.
This project addresses these challenges by creating an AI-based Mock Interview System Agent that uses voice-enabled AI and modern web technologies to deliver a scalable, personalized, and immersive mock interview experience
